mountains cold
To dungeons caverns old
We of day
To enchanted

dwarves of made mighty spells
hammers ringing
In places things
In hollow beneath fells

ancient elvish
a gleaming golden hoard
shaped wrought they caught
To in on of

On silver necklaces they strung
flowering on crowns
dragon-fire in twisted
meshed of
